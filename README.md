# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts housing prices in California using machine learning.  
It includes **data cleaning, visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment**.

---

## 📌 Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical features, scaled numeric features).  
- Explored and visualized data to understand feature distributions and correlations.  
- Trained multiple ML models: **Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor**.  
- Evaluated models with **cross-validation** and **RMSE**.  
- Built a **pipeline** for preprocessing and model training.  
- Saved the **Random Forest model** and preprocessing pipeline for deployment.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, joblib  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- Achieved low **RMSE** and consistent cross-validation performance.  
- Ready for deployment using saved model and pipeline files.
